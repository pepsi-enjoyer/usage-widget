# usage-widget

A small always-on-top desktop widget (Rust, egui) that shows how much of your
GitHub Copilot, Claude and Codex allowance you have used, in dollars. It
refreshes every five minutes and can be dragged anywhere on screen.

Credit-to-dollar rates live at the top of `src/providers.rs`:
Copilot 50,000 credits = $500, Codex 12,500 credits = $500. Claude reports
dollars directly. The footer total sums all three.

## How it gets the numbers

No logins of its own. It reuses credentials the CLIs already store locally:

| Service | Credential | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copilot | `gh auth token` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN`) | `api.github.com/copilot_internal/user` premium request quota |
| Claude | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` written by Claude Code | `api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/auth.json` written by Codex CLI | `chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` |

What is shown depends on the plan:

- Copilot: premium request credits used / entitlement.
- Claude: 5-hour and 7-day windows when the plan has them, plus monthly spend against the cap when present.
- Codex: 5-hour and weekly rate-limit windows when present, plus the workspace spend limit when present.

Tokens are read from disk on every refresh and never written back by the widget. If
Claude Code or the Codex CLI has not run for a while its access token expires; the
widget then runs a one-line headless prompt (`claude -p` on Haiku, or `codex exec` at
low reasoning effort, each at most once every 15 minutes) so the CLI refreshes the
token itself, and retries. The Copilot token comes from `gh auth token`, which does
not expire.

These endpoints are the same ones the CLIs and web settings pages use. They are not
formally documented and may change.

## Install

Windows only. Either download `usage-widget.exe` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/pepsi-enjoyer/usage-widget/releases/latest), put it
somewhere permanent and run it, or build it with a Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs):

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/pepsi-enjoyer/usage-widget
usage-widget --startup
usage-widget
```

`--startup` registers the exe in your per-user Run key so it launches at login;
`--no-startup` removes it. The widget stays out of the taskbar and Alt-Tab, so quit
it from its right-click menu.

Only one copy runs at a time, so launching it while it is already running does nothing.

From a clone, `install.ps1` does the same three steps using the local checkout.

## Updates

The widget checks GitHub for a newer release a minute after it starts and every six
hours after that. When there is one, it downloads the release's `usage-widget.exe`,
checks it against the release's SHA-256, swaps it in place of the running exe and
restarts. Right-click > Check for updates does the same on demand and tells you the
result. Set `USAGE_WIDGET_AUTO_UPDATE=0` to turn off the automatic check; the menu
item still works. Debug builds (`cargo run`) skip the automatic check.

To upgrade by hand instead, quit the widget first (Windows will not let a running exe
be replaced), then run the `cargo install` line again and start `usage-widget`. There
is no need to re-run `--startup`.

## Using it

- Drag anywhere on the widget to move it. Position is remembered between runs, and
  if the saved spot is off screen (say, a monitor is gone) it is moved back on.
- Right-click for refresh, minimize, size, check for updates, links to each service's
  usage page, and Quit. The menu also shows the installed version.
- Minimize shrinks it to one line (`COP 87%  CLD 83%  CDX 99%` with each service's logo),
  showing the most-used window per service. Maximize from the same menu restores it.
  Both views show each service's logo to the left of its name.
  The widget reopens in whichever mode it was left in.
- Size scales the widget from 25% to 200% on top of your display scaling (Ctrl +/-
  also works). Handy when a high-DPI monitor makes it too big. It is remembered.
- A service you have not set up on this machine (no `gh` login or Copilot plan, or
  never logged in to Claude Code or Codex) shows "Not Available" with an empty bar,
  or `N/A` when minimized. Other problems, like an expired token or no connection,
  show the same way with a short reason in red, or `!` when minimized. Hover it to
  see the full message.
- Set `USAGE_WIDGET_REFRESH_MINS` to change the refresh interval (default 5).
- Set `USAGE_WIDGET_OPACITY` (20-100) to change the window opacity (default 85).
